#competitive coding questions solved . 


Q 1)  LRU page replacement algorithm in which we have reference 
      strings and the no. of frames .

Q 2)  Kadenes algo to get the maximum value of subarray sum .we ca get max sum as well as
      that subarray .

Q 3) Check for the bALANCED Brackets function return true if balanced traversing algo in stack.

Q 4) Find for the largest Consecutive Strings .example "AABBBCDEEEEA" return {"E":4} traversing algo.

Q 5) Least Common Ancestor for both given nodes in tree.

Q 6) triplet whose sum is equal to the givne sum .

Q 7) Find the largest Area Under Histogram.
     in x axis take 1 unit distance and the height of bar graphs are
     [6,1,4,3,4,1] Output is 9 .research more on question we have solution 
     using stack Ds. O(n).

Q 8) we have an array [1,2,5] represents the coin denotion (1 re , 2rs, 5rs) coin 
     find the unique combination to add them to
     make the sum equals to given sum . coins are infinite available.
     suppose 5 is sum 
     output: [
                [1,1,1,1,1],
                [2,2,1],
                [5],
                [1,2,1,1]
              ]  

Q 9) Substring Problems using my favourite kmp algo hashing technique.
     test cases are there in the code .
