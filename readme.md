#competitive coding questions solved . 


Q 1)  LRU page replacement algorithm in which we have reference 
      strings and the no. of frames .

Q 2)  Kadenes algo to get the maximum value of subarray sum .we ca get max sum as well as
      that subarray .

Q 3) Check for the bALANCED Brackets function return true if balanced traversing algo in stack.

Q 4) Find for the largest Consecutive Strings .example "AABBBCDEEEEA" return {"E":4} traversing algo.

Q 5) Least Common Ancestor for both given nodes in tree.

Q 6) triplet whose sum is equal to the givne sum .

Q 7) Find the largest Area Under Histogram.
     in x axis take 1 unit distance and the height of bar graphs are
     [6,1,4,3,4,1] Output is 9 .research more on question we have solution 
     using stack Ds. O(n).

Q 8) we have an array [1,2,5] represents the coin denotion (1 re , 2rs, 5rs) coin 
     find the unique combination to add them to
     make the sum equals to given sum . coins are infinite available.
     suppose 5 is sum 
     output: [
                [1,1,1,1,1],
                [2,2,1],
                [5],
                [1,2,1,1]
              ]  

Q 9) Substring Problems using my favourite kmp algo hashing technique.
     test cases are there in the code .

Q 10). problem is we have an array find that pair with given sum k 
       the unique part is by using hashing .


Q 11) Dynamic Programming first question is if a number is given to you and told to make partitions of it
      and no. of ways to do partition of it is : eg : n=4    it can be a=[4+0,2+2,1+1+1+1,3+1,2+1+1] return len(a) -> result is 5 ways.

Q 12) Dynamic Programming longest common subsequence this will help us to find common subsequence b/w 2 strings.
      example : ("ABCD","ADBC") so your function return true as by removing "D" from both we get ABC OR by removing "C" we get "ABD".res=3


Q 13) Stack problem once again to get the next greater element : 

      example : [1,2,9,5,10,20,31,3] result is 1->2 , 2->9 ,9->10 ,5->10 ,10->20 ,20->31 ,31->no , 3->no.

 Q 14)Bfs and Dfs algos with one test case intro to backtracking .
 
 Q 15 ) Use Divide and Conquer Approach to find that is there any majority elemnt or not .
